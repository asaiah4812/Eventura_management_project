# Eventura Platform

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Project Overview
The Event Management Platform is a decentralized application designed to enable users to create, manage, and attend events efficiently and securely. Inspired by platforms like Luma, it leverages blockchain technology and decentralized storage for secure, transparent, and scalable event management.

## Target Audience
1. Event organizers
2. Event attendees

## Technical Architecture

### Blockchain Technology
- **Smart Contracts:** Deployed to handle event creation, registration, and ticket management.
- **Decentralized Storage:** Utilized to store event details and media files securely and ensure data integrity.

### Frontend Development
- **Framework:** Built using Next.js for a robust and efficient frontend.
- **UI/UX Design:** Designed with a user-friendly and intuitive interface.
- **Integration:** Seamlessly integrated with backend blockchain systems and decentralized storage solutions.

## Core Features

### Event Creation
- Users can create events with detailed information, including title, description, date, time, location, etc.
- Organizers can set ticket prices, quantities, and sales deadlines.

### Event Registration
- Secure and transparent event registration process.
- Decentralized ticketing system to prevent ticket fraud and scalping.

### Event Management
- Tools for organizers to manage event details, update information, and track registrations.
- Real-time updates and notifications for attendees.

### Decentralized Storage
- Event data and media files stored on a decentralized network to ensure data integrity and security.

### User Profiles
- Users can create profiles, view past events, and manage their tickets.

## Integration APIs
- **Payment Processing APIs:** Secure APIs for ticket purchases within the platform.

## Design Considerations
- **User Experience:** Seamless and intuitive user experience for both event organizers and attendees.
- **Scalability:** Designed to handle a large number of users and events simultaneously.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
